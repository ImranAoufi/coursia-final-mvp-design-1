Welcome to 'Setting Realistic Goals.' In this lesson, we will learn how to set achievable goals that align with a strong mindset. Goals are essential for providing direction and motivation. Start by defining your long-term vision. What do you want to achieve in the next five years? Once you have that vision, break it down into smaller, actionable steps. Use the SMART criteria: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. For example, instead of saying, 'I want to get fit,' specify 'I will exercise for 30 minutes, five times a week for the next three months.' This clarity will help you stay focused and motivated. After setting your goals, track your progress regularly. This will not only keep you accountable but also allow you to celebrate small victories along the way. Remember, it’s okay to adjust your goals as needed. Life can be unpredictable, and flexibility is key to maintaining a strong mindset. Thank you for joining me in this lesson on setting realistic goals.
