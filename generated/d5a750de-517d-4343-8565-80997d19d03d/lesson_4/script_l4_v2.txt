Welcome back to 'Building Consistency in Workouts.' Consistency is key to a sustainable fitness routine. Start by setting realistic goals—consider how many days a week you can realistically commit to working out. Create a schedule and treat these workout times as unmissable appointments. Use reminders on your phone or calendar to stay accountable. Also, find a workout buddy to encourage each other and share progress. Remember, it's okay to miss a day; just get back on track as soon as possible. As you build your routine, reflect on what times of day you feel most energetic and motivated to work out. Aim for at least three consistent days of exercise this week. Let’s make fitness a regular part of your life!
