Welcome to 'Finding Activities You Love.' In this video, we will explore how to discover fitness activities that you genuinely enjoy. Start by reflecting on your past experiences with physical activities. Think about what you loved as a child—were you dancing, swimming, or playing sports? Next, try out different classes or activities, such as yoga, kickboxing, or hiking. Use a trial-and-error approach; attend a few sessions and pay attention to how they make you feel. Remember, the goal is to find joy in movement. Keep an open mind and be willing to step out of your comfort zone. Make a list of three activities you want to try this week, and commit to attending at least one session for each. Let's get moving towards finding your passion for fitness!
