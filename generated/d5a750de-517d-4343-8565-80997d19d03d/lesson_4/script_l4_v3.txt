Welcome to 'Tracking Progress Effectively.' Tracking your progress is crucial to staying motivated and making adjustments to your routine. Start by choosing a method that works for you—this could be a fitness app, a journal, or even a simple spreadsheet. Record your workouts, how you felt afterward, and any changes in your body or energy levels. Set achievable milestones and celebrate when you reach them, whether it's completing a certain number of workouts or increasing your weights. Regularly review your progress to see what's working and what might need adjustment. This week, make a commitment to track your workouts and reflect on how you feel afterward. Let’s keep moving forward together!
