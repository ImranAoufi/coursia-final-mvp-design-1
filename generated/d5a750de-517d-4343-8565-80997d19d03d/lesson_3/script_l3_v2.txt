In this video, we will tackle healthy eating on a budget. Eating well doesn't have to break the bank. Start by planning your meals for the week. This helps you avoid impulse buys and reduces food waste. Make a shopping list based on your meal plan and stick to it. Look for sales and use coupons to save money. When shopping, focus on whole foods like grains, beans, and seasonal produce, which are often cheaper and healthier. Buy in bulk when you can, as this often lowers the cost per serving. Also, consider preparing meals at home instead of dining out. Cooking in batches and freezing portions can save both time and money. Remember, healthy eating is possible within your budget with a little planning and creativity.
