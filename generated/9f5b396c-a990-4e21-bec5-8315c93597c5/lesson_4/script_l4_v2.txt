Welcome to 'Building a Network for Long-Term Success.' In this video, we’ll focus on the importance of networking during and after your YCombinator program. Start by identifying key individuals within your cohort and mentors. Schedule one-on-one meetings to learn from their experiences. Attend networking events, both virtual and in-person, to expand your reach. Remember, follow-ups are essential; send a quick email or message to keep the conversation going. Additionally, consider joining alumni groups to stay connected with past participants. Networking is not just about what you can gain, but also what you can offer. Be generous with your knowledge and support. Building a strong network will open doors long after your YCombinator journey ends. Thank you for watching, and good luck!
