In this video, we will build your vocabulary toolkit for understanding Islamic texts better. Start by creating flashcards for the key terms we discussed: Hadith, Quran, Sunnah, and Sharia. Write the word on one side and its definition on the other. Regularly review these flashcards to enhance retention. Additionally, practice using these words in sentences. For example, you can say, 'The Hadith provides guidance on daily life.' Lastly, consider joining a study group or online forum to discuss these terms with peers. Engaging with others will reinforce your learning and provide diverse perspectives. Remember, the more you practice, the more fluent you will become in Islamic vocabulary.
