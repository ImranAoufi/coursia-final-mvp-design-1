Welcome to our lesson on Key Vocabulary for Hadiths and Quran. In this video, we will explore commonly used words in Islamic texts. Understanding these terms is crucial for grasping the essence of the teachings. Let's start with the word 'Hadith'. A Hadith refers to the sayings, actions, and approvals of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Next, we have 'Quran', which is the holy book of Islam, believed to be the literal word of God as revealed to Muhammad. Other important terms include 'Sunnah', which is the practice based on Hadith, and 'Sharia', referring to Islamic law derived from both the Quran and Sunnah. As we progress, keep these words in mind, as they form the foundation of Islamic knowledge. Now, let's move to the next video where we will focus on building your vocabulary toolkit.
