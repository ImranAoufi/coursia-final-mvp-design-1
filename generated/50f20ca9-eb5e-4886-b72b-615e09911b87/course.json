          "script_content": "Welcome back! In this video, we will focus on overcoming limiting beliefs. Limiting beliefs are the thoughts that hold you back from reaching your full potential. The first step to overcoming them is to identify what they are. Take a moment to write down any negative thoughts you have about your abilities or worth. Next, challenge these beliefs. Ask yourself: Is this thought really true? What evidence do I have to support or refute it? Replace limiting beliefs with empowering affirmations. For example, change 'I can't succeed' to 'I have the skills and determination to succeed.' Visualize your success; imagine yourself achieving your goals and the feelings associated with that success. Lastly, take action despite your fears. Start small, and with each step, you’ll build confidence. Remember, your mindset shapes your reality. Thank you for joining me in this journey to build a million-dollar mindset."
