Welcome back! In this video, we will focus on setting financial goals and milestones for your business plan. Financial goals are crucial as they provide a roadmap for your business. Start by defining short-term and long-term financial goals. For example, a short-term goal might be to achieve a specific revenue target in the first year. A long-term goal could be expanding your product line in five years. Next, let's discuss milestones. These are specific checkpoints that help you measure your progress. Examples include launching your product, reaching a certain number of customers, or securing funding. Make sure your goals are SMART: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. By setting clear goals and milestones, you create a framework for tracking your success and adjusting your strategies as needed. In our next video, we'll wrap things up with tips on how to finalize your business plan.
