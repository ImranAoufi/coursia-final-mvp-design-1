Welcome to our lesson on Crafting Your Unique Value Proposition. In this video, we will define your startup's mission. Start by asking yourself: What problem does your startup solve? Consider your target audience and their pain points. Your mission should reflect not just what you do, but why you do it. Next, think about your core values. These are the principles that guide your decisions and actions. Write down three key values that resonate with your mission. Finally, articulate your mission statement. It should be clear, concise, and inspire both you and your team. Remember, a strong mission statement is the foundation of your unique value proposition. Let's move on to how to effectively communicate this value.
