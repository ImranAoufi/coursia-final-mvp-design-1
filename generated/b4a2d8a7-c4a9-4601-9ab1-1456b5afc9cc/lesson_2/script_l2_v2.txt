Welcome to 'Setting Realistic Goals.' Setting goals gives us direction and purpose. Start by using the SMART criteria: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound. For example, instead of saying, 'I want to get fit,' say, 'I will exercise for 30 minutes, three times a week for the next month.' Break your goals into smaller, manageable steps. This will help you stay motivated and track your progress. Review your goals regularly and adjust them as necessary to ensure they remain realistic and aligned with your overall vision. Let's get started on setting those goals!
