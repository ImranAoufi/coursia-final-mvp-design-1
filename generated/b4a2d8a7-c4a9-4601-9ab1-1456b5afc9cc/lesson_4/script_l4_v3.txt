In our final video, we’ll cover tracking progress effectively. Tracking your progress helps you stay motivated and see how far you’ve come. Start by setting clear, achievable goals, whether it’s improving endurance, strength, or flexibility. Use a journal or fitness app to log your workouts, noting the exercises, duration, and how you felt. Consider taking progress photos or measurements to visually track changes over time. Regularly review your progress and adjust your goals as needed. Remember, it’s not just about numbers; it’s about how you feel and the joy of movement. Keep pushing forward!
