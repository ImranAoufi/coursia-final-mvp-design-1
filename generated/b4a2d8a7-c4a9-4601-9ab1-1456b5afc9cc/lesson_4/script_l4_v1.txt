Welcome to our first video in the lesson 'Creating a Sustainable Fitness Routine.' Today, we're focusing on finding activities you love. Start by reflecting on what you enjoyed doing as a child—was it running, dancing, or playing sports? Make a list of those activities. Next, explore new options! Try a class or a sport you've never done before. Use online resources like YouTube to find beginner workouts. Remember, the key is enjoyment. If you love what you're doing, you'll be more likely to stick with it. Take some time this week to try at least two new activities and see how they make you feel. Keep your mind open and have fun!
