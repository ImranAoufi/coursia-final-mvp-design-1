Welcome back! In this video, we’ll discuss building consistency in your workouts. Consistency is crucial for a sustainable fitness routine. Start by setting a realistic schedule that fits your lifestyle. Choose specific days and times for your workouts, and treat them as important appointments. Use reminders on your phone or calendar to keep you accountable. Another helpful tip is to find a workout buddy—having someone to exercise with can increase motivation. Lastly, don’t forget to celebrate your small victories, whether it’s completing a week of workouts or lifting heavier weights. Consistency is about progress, not perfection. Let’s get moving!
