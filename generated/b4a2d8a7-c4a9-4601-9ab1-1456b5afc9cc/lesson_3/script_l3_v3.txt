Welcome to 'Meal Prep Made Easy.' Meal prepping is a great way to save time and ensure you have healthy meals ready to go. Start by choosing one day a week to prep your meals. Gather your ingredients and decide on a few recipes that you can batch cook. Cook grains like rice or quinoa in large quantities, and roast a variety of vegetables. Portion everything into containers for easy access during the week. Don't forget to include protein sources like chicken, tofu, or chickpeas. Label your containers with dates to keep track of freshness. Finally, keep it simple! You don't need to prepare every meal; even prepping lunches or snacks can make a big difference. With these meal prep strategies, you'll be set up for success in your nutrition journey!
