Be prepared to articulate your startup idea, why it matters, and how you plan to execute it. Remember to practice your pitch, keeping it under two minutes.

First, remember to take a moment to breathe before responding. It’s okay to pause and think. When faced with a challenging question, use the STAR method: Situation, Task, Action, Result. This framework helps structure your answer clearly. For example, if asked about a failure, describe the situation, what your task was, the action you took, and the result. Be honest about your experiences; showing vulnerability can build rapport. Additionally, practice common tough questions such as 'What are your weaknesses?' or 'Why should we invest in you?' Have your answers ready but remain flexible to adapt based on the flow of conversation. Lastly, always end your answers by tying back to your passion for the project and your vision for the future. Thank you for joining this lesson, and best of luck in your interviews!"
