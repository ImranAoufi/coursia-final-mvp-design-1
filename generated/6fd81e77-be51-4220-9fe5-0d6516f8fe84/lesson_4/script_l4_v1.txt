Welcome to our first video on Active Listening Techniques. In this video, we will explore how to enhance your listening skills in communication. Active listening involves not just hearing the words spoken, but also understanding the message behind them. To practice active listening, start by maintaining eye contact with the speaker. This shows that you are engaged and interested. Next, use verbal affirmations like 'I see' or 'Go on' to encourage the speaker. Additionally, summarize what you've heard by saying things like, 'So what you're saying is...' This not only clarifies your understanding but also shows the speaker that their message is valued. Remember, active listening requires patience and practice. Let's move on to our next topic: Listening to Understand, Not Respond.
