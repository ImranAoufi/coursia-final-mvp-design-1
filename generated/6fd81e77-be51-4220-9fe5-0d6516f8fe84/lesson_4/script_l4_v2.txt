In our second video, we focus on Listening to Understand, Not Respond. Often in conversations, we are eager to respond rather than fully understand the other person’s point of view. To change this habit, take a moment to pause before replying. This allows you to process what has been said and formulate a response that is thoughtful and relevant. Additionally, ask open-ended questions to dive deeper into the speaker's thoughts. Questions like, 'Can you tell me more about that?' encourage elaboration and demonstrate your genuine interest. Finally, be aware of your body language; nodding and leaning slightly forward can signal that you are engaged. By prioritizing understanding, you not only improve your communication skills but also build stronger relationships.
