Welcome back! In this segment, we will focus on creating a supportive environment for study. Start by establishing a dedicated space for Quranic study, whether it’s at home or in a community center. This space should be quiet, comfortable, and free from distractions. Next, encourage mentorship within your community. Pair experienced learners with newcomers to guide them in their journey. Additionally, provide resources such as books, online courses, and access to knowledgeable speakers. Remember to celebrate milestones, whether big or small, to motivate learners. Lastly, ensure that your environment is respectful and open to questions. Let’s work together to build a thriving community centered around the Quran.
