Reflect on the following:
- Identify one Quranic principle you will apply this week. How will you practice it?
- Write about a recent interaction where you could have been more respectful. What will you do differently next time?
- List three things you are grateful for today and why they matter to you.
- Think of a person you need to forgive. Write a short letter to them (you don't need to send it) expressing your feelings.
- Set a daily reminder to reflect on your actions in light of Quranic teachings.
