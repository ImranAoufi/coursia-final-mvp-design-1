Welcome to 'Tracking Progress: Metrics that Matter'. In this video, we'll explore how to measure strength improvements effectively. First, let's discuss what strength metrics are important. Key metrics include your one-rep max, volume lifted, and frequency of workouts. To measure your one-rep max, start with a weight you can lift comfortably for several reps. Gradually increase the weight until you find your maximum for one rep. Keep a record of this number. Next, let's talk about volume. This is calculated by multiplying the weight lifted by the number of sets and reps. For example, if you lift 100 pounds for 5 sets of 5 reps, your volume is 2500 pounds. Lastly, track the frequency of your workouts. Are you training each muscle group once a week, twice, or more? Consistency is key to progress. Now, let's summarize: measure your one-rep max, calculate your volume, and track workout frequency. These metrics will help you see improvements over time. In our next video, we will discuss how to adjust your program for continuous growth. Stay tuned!
