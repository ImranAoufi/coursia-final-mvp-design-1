Welcome back! In this video, we will discuss adjusting your program for continuous growth. It's essential to adapt your training as you progress. First, increase the weight you lift gradually. Aim for a 5-10% increase in weight when you can complete all your sets and reps comfortably. Secondly, consider varying your exercises. If you always do the same movements, your muscles can adapt, leading to a plateau. Introduce new exercises or change the order of your routine. Thirdly, incorporate deload weeks. These are periods where you reduce your training volume or intensity, allowing your muscles to recover and grow. Lastly, listen to your body. If you're feeling fatigued, it might be time to adjust your program. Remember, tracking your progress is about more than just numbers; it's about understanding your body and making informed decisions. Thanks for watching, and keep pushing towards your goals!
