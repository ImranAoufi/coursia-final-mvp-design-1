Welcome to 'Nutrition for Strength: Fueling Your Gains'. In this video, we'll explore macronutrients, the building blocks of your diet. First, let's define macronutrients: proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. Each plays a crucial role in muscle growth and recovery. Proteins are essential for repairing and building muscle tissue. Aim for 1.6 to 2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight daily. Next, carbohydrates provide the energy needed for intense workouts. Focus on complex carbs like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. Finally, healthy fats support hormone production and overall health. Include sources like avocados, nuts, and olive oil in your diet. Remember, balance is key! Track your intake and adjust as needed to fuel your gains effectively.
