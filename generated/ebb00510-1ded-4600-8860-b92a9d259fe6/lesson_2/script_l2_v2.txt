Welcome back! In this video, we will discuss meal planning for muscle growth. Start by setting your daily caloric needs based on your activity level and goals. Use a food diary or app to track what you eat. Aim for 5-6 smaller meals throughout the day to maintain energy levels and support muscle repair. Each meal should include a source of protein, complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats. For example, a meal could consist of grilled chicken, quinoa, and steamed broccoli. Don’t forget to hydrate; water is vital for muscle function. Lastly, prepare meals in advance to avoid unhealthy choices. With proper planning, you can ensure you’re consistently fueling your body for strength gains.
