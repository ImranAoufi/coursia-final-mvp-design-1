Welcome to 'Foundations of Strength Training'. In this video, we will explore the primary muscle groups involved in strength training. Let's start with the major muscle groups: the chest, back, legs, shoulders, arms, and core. Each group plays a crucial role in compound and isolation exercises. For instance, the chest muscles, including the pectoralis major and minor, are primarily targeted during bench presses and push-ups. The back muscles, such as the latissimus dorsi and trapezius, engage during rows and pull-ups. Legs consist of quadriceps, hamstrings, and calves, which are worked during squats and deadlifts. Shoulders, primarily the deltoids, are engaged in overhead presses. Arms include biceps and triceps, which are targeted in curls and extensions. Finally, the core, including the abdominals and obliques, is essential for stability in all movements. Understanding these muscle groups will help you design effective strength training programs. Now, let's move on to how these muscles gain strength.
