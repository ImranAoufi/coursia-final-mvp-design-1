In this video, we will discuss the science behind strength gains. Strength training works on the principle of progressive overload, which means gradually increasing the weight, frequency, or number of repetitions in your workout. This stimulates muscle fibers to adapt and grow stronger. During strength training, micro-tears occur in the muscle fibers, which the body repairs, leading to increased muscle size and strength. Additionally, hormones like testosterone and growth hormone play vital roles in muscle recovery and growth. It's also important to consider nutrition; protein intake is essential for muscle repair. Remember, rest and recovery are just as crucial as the training itself, as muscles need time to heal and grow stronger. Understanding this science will empower you to train smarter, not harder. Thank you for watching, and let's apply this knowledge in our training.
