In this video, we will discuss common mistakes when attempting a backflip and how to avoid them. One common mistake is not jumping high enough; make sure to focus on your vertical leap. Another issue is over-rotating, which can lead to falls. Remember to keep your body tight and control your rotation. Additionally, avoid looking down during your flip; instead, gaze back to help maintain orientation. Lastly, don’t forget to practice your landing; a solid landing will prevent injuries.
