Welcome to 'Practicing with Confidence: Safe Drills.' In this video, we will focus on progressive drills to achieve your backflip successfully. We'll start with basic jumps to build your comfort level. Begin with a standing jump, focusing on your takeoff. Remember to keep your arms strong and your core engaged. Next, let's progress to a back handspring to introduce the backward motion. Ensure you have a soft surface or mat to practice on. As you feel more comfortable, try adding a back tuck by jumping slightly higher. Always visualize your landing and keep practicing these steps until you feel confident. Remember, safety first! Use a spotter if you can, and never rush the process. Now, let’s move on to the next drill.
