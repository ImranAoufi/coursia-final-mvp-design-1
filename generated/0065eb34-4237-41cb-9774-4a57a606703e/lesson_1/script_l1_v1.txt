Welcome to 'Warm-Up Essentials for Backflips'. In this video, we will focus on warming up your body to prepare for backflips. Start with a light jog in place for 2 minutes to increase your heart rate. Next, perform dynamic stretches: arm circles for 30 seconds, followed by leg swings, 15 seconds each leg. Now, let's move to the back extension stretch. Lie on your stomach, place your hands under your shoulders, and push up gently, holding for 15 seconds. Repeat this 3 times. Finally, let's do some shoulder dislocates with a resistance band or broomstick. Hold it wide and rotate it over your head, repeating this 10 times. Remember, a proper warm-up can prevent injuries and enhance performance. Let's get ready to flip!
