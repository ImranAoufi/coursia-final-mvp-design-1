Welcome back to 'Strengthening Your Core for Stability'. A strong core is essential for executing backflips safely. Start with a plank position, hold for 30 seconds, focusing on keeping your body straight. Next, do 15 Russian twists, keeping your feet off the ground for added difficulty. Follow this with 10 hanging leg raises; if you can’t hang, do lying leg raises on the ground. Now, let's move to 15 bicycle crunches to target those obliques. Finally, finish with a 30-second boat pose to engage your entire core. A strong core will not only help your backflips but also improve your overall athletic performance. Stay strong and keep practicing!
