Welcome back! In this video, we will explore the key techniques for a perfect takeoff in your backflip. The takeoff starts with your feet shoulder-width apart. Bend your knees and lower your hips to gather strength. As you explode upwards, swing your arms overhead to create upward momentum. It’s essential to push through your toes at the moment of takeoff to maximize height. Remember to keep your core tight to maintain balance during your ascent. After takeoff, quickly tuck your knees to your chest to initiate the flip. Practice this motion repeatedly to develop muscle memory. Now that you understand the mechanics and techniques, it's time to practice safely. Always use a mat and start with low heights. Good luck, and keep practicing!
