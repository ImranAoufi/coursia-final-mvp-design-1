Welcome back! In this video, we will discuss handling tough questions during your YC interview. First, anticipate the questions you might face. Common tough questions include inquiries about competition, financial projections, and team dynamics. Prepare your answers in advance. Use the STAR method: Situation, Task, Action, Result. This will help you structure your responses clearly. When faced with a tough question, take a moment to think before answering. It's okay to pause. If you don't know the answer, admit it and offer to follow up later. This shows honesty and integrity. Additionally, practice active listening. Make sure you understand the question fully before responding. Finally, maintain a positive demeanor. Your attitude can influence how your answers are perceived. Practice answering tough questions with a friend or mentor to gain feedback. Now, you're equipped to tackle your YC interview with confidence!
