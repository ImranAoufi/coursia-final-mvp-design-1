Welcome to our lesson on 'Embracing the Foundations of Faith'. Today, we will explore the concept of Tawheed, which is the oneness of Allah. Tawheed is the cornerstone of Islamic belief. It emphasizes the uniqueness and singularity of Allah. Understanding Tawheed means recognizing that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah. We will discuss the three categories of Tawheed: Tawheed al-Rububiyyah, which is the belief in Allah's lordship; Tawheed al-Uluhiyyah, which pertains to the worship of Allah alone; and Tawheed al-Asma wa al-Sifat, which involves understanding Allah's names and attributes. Remember, embracing Tawheed leads to a deeper connection with Allah and strengthens our faith. Reflect on how Tawheed influences your daily life and relationship with Allah. Thank you for joining us in this vital exploration of faith.
